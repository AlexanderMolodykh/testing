As code style is not so imprtant I had wrote it as script with static methods.

Each project has section ``` // script parameters ``` where user can type manual parameters

Each project also has ``` // script parameters``` where user can twick script for concreat requirements and machine power (current params work fine with my old non SSD machine, as I am not allowed to do tests tasks on machine for work)

Two console projects there:
- RandomFileGenerator - to generate random file (used produce consumer pattern)
- FileSorter - creates file with prefix "result_" which contains sorted data. Map/Reduce approach.
